Temporary 'Bookmark'
====================

* eval leaks memory (probably a WebKit issue.)
* js -> Rust interface not yet implemented.

The original README follows.

rust-webview
============
⚠️ This project is a work in progress. Very alpha. Really.

This crate uses C bindings from [zserge/webview](1) to display a Rust controllable
webview for rendering modern UI interfaces using web technology. Included features:

* Render HTML5, JavaScript and CSS in a full-fledged browser environment
* Call Rust from JavaScript and JavaScript from Rust
* Cross-platform: uses WebKit (Cocoa) on macOS, WebKit (GTK) on Linux and MSHTML on Windows
* Controllable window properties: title, width, height and fullscreen
* Compile to a single small binary: `hello_world` example is less than `200KB` when packed
* Controllable dialogs: alerts (info, warning, error), open and save files
* Embeddable content for offline usage
* Can render arbitrary HTML or a full external website
* Think about it as an Electron app but `121MB` smaller

### Example

```rust
extern crate webview;

use webview::{Content, WebView};

fn main() {
    let view = WebView::new(
        "My awesome title",                     // The title of the window
        Content::Html("<h1>Hello world!</h1>"), // The content to display
        200,                                    // Width
        100,                                    // Height
        false,                                  // Resizable?
        false,                                  // Debugable?
    ).unwrap();

    // Starts the event loop
    view.join();
}
```
